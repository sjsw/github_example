#         observation with covariance matrix m.sparse.  Check that the covariance

# Task 3: Calculate the principal components using the four
#         functions svd(), irlba(), eigen(), and irlba().
#         With irlba(), just look at the top five.
#         Confirm that they give the same answer.  Note:

# Task 4: Use microbenchmark to compare the speeds.  What method
#         is the fastest?


# Task 5: Implement the power method to find the top eigenvalue
#         and eigenvector.  (You can use a for loop.)  Check that
#         it matches the other methods.
# Task 6: Use your favorite method to experiment with PCA on
#         non-centered, non-scaled columns.  How does centering and
#         scaling affect the PCA analysis?

# If you get stuck, you can find answers to all but task 6 in big_pca.R, though it will
# be best if you do it yourself!
